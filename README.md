# Subly Challenge

Let people know what your project can do specifically. Provide context and add a link to any reference visitors might be unfamiliar with. A list of Features or a Background subsection can also be added here. If there are alternatives to your project, this is a good place to list differentiating factors.

## ðŸ“– How to use
This is a page that lists media data retrieved from API endpoint. 
You can choose which mediums to display using the dropdowns placed on the top left of the page. Both dropdowns work in tandem ãƒ¼ã€€if you select 'Ready' in the status dropdown and 'Dutch' in the language dropdown, the list shows only one medium that meets both of these conditions. 
Also once hovering over the ready medium, you can see edit and delete icons.
The page has been made user-friendly: it shows a circular progress animation on while media is being retrieved; and it is perfectly responsive to different screen sizes.
