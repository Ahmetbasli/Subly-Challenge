# Subly Challenge

This is a page that lists all the media uploaded by a Subly user.

## ðŸ“– How to use
You can choose which mediums to display using the dropdowns placed on the top left of the page. Both dropdowns work in tandem ãƒ¼ã€€if you select 'Ready' in the status dropdown and 'Dutch' in the language dropdown, the list shows only one medium that meets both of these conditions. 
Also once hovering over the ready medium, you can see edit and delete icons.
The page has been made user-friendly: it shows a circular progress animation on while media is being retrieved; and it is perfectly responsive to different screen sizes.
